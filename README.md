# IS362-Week8-Assignment - Auto MPG Dataset EDA
Overview:
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis focuses on investigating the relationship between vehicle attributes (such as weight, horsepower, and number of cylinders) and fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon - MPG).

Key Tasks Completed:
- Loaded and cleaned the Auto MPG dataset

- Tidied the data by renaming columns and handling missing values

- Converted categorical codes (origin) into descriptive labels

- Performed exploratory visualizations including:

-- Bar plot showing distribution of cylinders

-- Scatter plot of horsepower vs. weight

--Correlation heatmap of numeric variables

--Scatter plot of horsepower vs. mpg

--Boxplot of mpg vs. cylinders

- Summarized key findings and insights regarding fuel efficiency trends

Tools Used:
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how EDA can be used to uncover patterns in vehicle design and fuel economy. The findings offer valuable insights into how factors like vehicle weight and engine size influence MPG.
